# Inventory.ai

## Introduction

Inventory.ai simplifies inventory management for small to medium-sized businesses by utilizing AI to quickly add items to their inventory through photos. Users can take pictures of items, and the system uses AI to estimate prices and details, which are then saved to their inventory.

## Core Features

- **New Account Creation:** Users can create a new account by providing their email and password.
